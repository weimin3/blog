      Hello, and welcome to Weimin's personal website!
      
      WeiMin is currently studying for a master's degree at the University of Zurich, majoring in data science and minoring in informatics.
      
      Prior to that, she had two years of experience as an ERP engineer. She also worked as an internal auditor for five years and holds CIA (Certified Internal Auditor) and CISA (Certified Information Systems Auditor) certifications. Years of working experience have made her intimately familiar with the governance, management and implementation of information technology and relevant problems faced by businesses, also understand the importance of information technology to internal control of enterprises. She had some thoughts of her own on the subjects. Work experience not only gave her extensive experience in information systems implementation, risk assessment and auditing related to information technology and information systems, but also gave her the opportunity to accumulate rich experience in project management.
      
      In addition to studying and working, she is someone who enjoys enjoying life by hiking, playing squash, tennis, going to the concert hall alone to enjoy the symphony, watching animation, and is addicted to watching the starry sky.
